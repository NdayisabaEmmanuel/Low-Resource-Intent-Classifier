# Intent Classifier For Low Resource Languages

This is an implementation of a baseline for low resource language intent classier model discussed in detail in the attached file.
The model recognizes a sequence of phonemes and output an intent. 

To emulate a low resource situation, the model is trained and evaluated on different combinations of speakers and  utterances.
Starting with one speaker and one utterance up to 7 speakers and 7 utterances. Basically the model is trained and evaluated on 49
different combinations.
